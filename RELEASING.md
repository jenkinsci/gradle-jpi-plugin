Releasing the Gradle JPI Plugin
===============================

These are the instructions to release the Gradle JPI Plugin.


Prerequisites
-------------

The following Gradle properties must be set:

- `gradle.publish.key` (from Gradle Plugin Portal)
- `gradle.publish.secret` (from Gradle Plugin Portal)
- `jenkins.username` (from Jenkins Account)
- `jenkins.password` (from Jenkins Account)
- `signingKeyId` (GPG Signing Key ID)
- `signingPassword` (GPG Passphrase)
